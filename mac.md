## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?    Git is an open source version control software that allows coders to perform three essential functions with their projects: 1. Backup their work 2. Archive older versions, creating a useful fall back option if changes aren't completed properly and 3. A way to collaborate with other coders on the same project at the same time.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? While Git is a tool as described above, GitHub is a for-profit company that offers cloud-based hosting of projects. Using Git, this platform provides a convenient location for tracking, collaboration, and sharing of work.
3. Why do we create a branch? We will create a branch so that we can work independently on a particular project without clashing with other collaborators. We are also able to have multiple branches on our own system, which allows us to test different versions.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?  A pull request allows you to tell other people about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository. It provides a place for conversations about the change and acts as a holding area before any changes are merged into the base branch.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. git checkout main
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? Git fetch is the command that tells the local repository that there are changes available in the remote repository without bringing the changes into the local repository. Git Pull on the other hand brings the copy of the remote directory changes into the local repository. When comparing Git pull vs fetch, Git fetch is a safer alternative because it pulls in all the commits from your remote but doesn't make any changes to your local files. On the other hand, Git pull is faster as you're performing multiple actions in one try. The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch. Git merge will combine multiple sequences of commits into one unified history. In the most frequent use cases, git merge is used to combine two branches.
7. What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in the code between two commits. An example would be if one person edited a line of code inside of a file while another person delted that file on their branch.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? Resolving a merge conflict depends on the complexity of the issue. In some cases, it is possible to resolve the issue on GitHub itself. In the pull request, click the button that says "Resolve coflicts" and then decide if you want to keep only your branch's changes, keep only the other branch's changes, or make a brand new change, which may incorporate changes from both branches. Delete the conflict markers <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>> and make the changes you want in the final merge. Repeat this process for all conflics and then mark as Resolved. Repeat for any other files with conflicts. If this is not an option, you will need to work in the command line. Once you have navigated to the local Git repository, generate a list of files affected by the merge conflict by typing git status. Within the text editor of your choice, resolve each conflict in a similar fashion as above, making sure to remove all conflict markers. When you are done, add your changes and commit with a detailed comment. At this point it will be possible to merge branches.
